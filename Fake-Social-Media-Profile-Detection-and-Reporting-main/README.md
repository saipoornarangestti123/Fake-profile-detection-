# Fake-Social-Media-Profile-Detection-and-Reporting

Abstract:

In today's digital age, the prevalence of fake accounts on social media platforms poses a significant challenge for users, businesses, and platforms alike. To address this issue, we have developed an Instagram and Twitter account detection system using machine learning techniques. 

Our system utilizes supervised learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest Classifier, to analyze various features of user profiles and determine the likelihood of an account being fake or real. For Instagram, features such as profile picture presence, username characteristics, post frequency, follower count, and other attributes are considered. Similarly, for Twitter, factors like abuse reports, friend requests, follower count, likes, and comments per day are examined.

The system is implemented using Python's Flask framework to create a web application interface. Users can input the necessary information about a social media account through a simple form, and the system provides predictions on the authenticity of the account. Depending on the prediction, users are directed to result pages indicating whether the account is classified as fake or real.

Through this project, we aim to provide users with a tool to assist in identifying potentially fraudulent accounts, thereby enhancing their safety and trust in online interactions. Additionally, businesses and social media platforms can leverage such systems to mitigate the spread of misinformation and maintain a secure online environment.
